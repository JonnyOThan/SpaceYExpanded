## Version 1.0.0.0-release - Stable

* 17 Dec 2015
* Released for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.5

* Let's call this the 1.0 release. Things have been pretty stable lately.
* Added "SpaceY_ATM.cfg" with settings to attempt to disable or dissuade ActiveTextureManagement for this mod.
  * Can optionally be deleted to return to ATM defaults.
  * ATM known to occasionally have caching issues with remapped/shared textures in my mods.
  * SpaceY is already very memory efficient and uses DDS, so ATM doesn't help much for this case.
  * May need to delete ATM's cache if using ATM and some textures still aren't appearing.
* Updated 7.5m stack decoupler:
  * Ejection charge reduced by half (to 500, down from 1000).
  * Added built-in "sepratron" solid propellant separator motors.
  * Research cost increased slightly.
* Replaced "placeholder" textures. Smaller, and more obvious when texture reassignment has failed.
* Corrected a texture assignment problem on the 7.5m E2 engine.

## Version 0.9.0.0-release - KSP 1.0.5 update

* 11 Nov 2015
* Released for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.5

* Corrected the display-name of the "Gigantic Structure" tech node, instead of displaying it as a second "Massive Structure" node.
* Diameters added to 7.5m fuel tank names, for easy identification in VAB menu.
* Updated heat shield to current stock ablator settings and contract constraints. Slightly increased ablator quantity.
* Updated all engines to use FXModuleAnimateThrottle for heat animation.
* Engines, fairings, decouplers/separators updated to use new stock-alike thermal settings and contract constraints.
* Lightened the color and "grain" of the white texture on fuel tanks (will also affect 5m tanks).

## Version 0.8.0.0-release - Beta, engine updates

* 16 Oct 2015
* Released for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.4

* Adjusted R9 engine HotRockets config to correspond to SpaceY Lifters' fixes (as of Lifters v1.3).
* R9 engine now uses custom default engine effects from SpaceY Lifters (requires Lifters v1.3+).
* R9 engine now uses new engine bell art assets from SpaceY Lifters 1.3+.
* New default custom particle effects for LFO engines (E,P series).

## Version 0.7.0.0-release - Beta

* 09 Oct 2015
* Released for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.4

* Corrected the cross-section profile on several parts (mainly Emu engines and decoupler/separators).
* Fuel tanks now have multiple paint schemes, selectable if InterstellarFuelSwitch or Firespitter are installed.
  * Known issue: Will have nasty z-fighting with all paint schemes at once, if something tricks ModuleManager about Interstelar/Firespitter installed state. Might have to delete ModuleManager config cache.
